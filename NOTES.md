# Notes to self

This repository exists to externalize my engineering judgement.

- It is not meant to be impressive.
- It is not meant to grow fast.
- It is meant to stay honest over time.

If I ever feel tempted to add convenience helpers,
framework abstractions, or smart defaults,
I should re-read the README and red-lines.

This project started because I wanted a place
where boundaries are explicit,
and decisions are not hidden in helpers.
