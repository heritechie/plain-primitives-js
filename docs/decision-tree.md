# Primitive Decision Tree

This document helps decide whether a proposed component is a primitive or something else.

## Questions

1. Does this still make sense without knowing the use case?
2. Does it provide a signal rather than a decision?
3. Is the API free from domain or business language?
4. Would this still feel natural in another language?
5. Does it avoid hidden behavior or smart defaults?

If there is doubt, the answer is no.
